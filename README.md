<h2 id="about">The A8 Stack</h2>

The _"A8 Stack"_ is a TypeScript development stack made by [Alex73630](https://twitter.com/alex73630) focused on **simplicity**, **modularity**, and **full-stack typesafety**. It consists of:

-   [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org)
-   [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
-   [T3-Env](https://env.t3.gg/)

### So... what is `create-a8-app`? A template?

Kind of? `create-a8-app` is a CLI built by seasoned A8 Stack devs to streamline the setup of a modular A8 Stack app. This means each piece is optional, and the "template" is generated based on your specific needs.

After countless projects and many years on this tech, we have lots of opinions and insights. Weâ€™ve done our best to encode them into this CLI.

This is **NOT** an all-inclusive template. We **expect** you to bring your own libraries that solve the needs of **YOUR** application.
